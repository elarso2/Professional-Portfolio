The goal of this homework assignment was to create a website, from scratch, that is a professional portfolio of my work. I was meant to use my current knowledge of HTML and CSS skills to create my web-based application.

The final website requirements, which have been pulled from my assignment page, can be found below:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

My final site should be deployed at a live URL, and include live URLs for some projects I have already completed. It should also roughly resemble the mock-up site that we were provided with in our assignment README, and can be viewed in the image below. Just below that one, you will find a screenshot of my personal professional portfolio webpage.
