The goal of this homework assignment is to create a website, from scratch, that is a professional portfolio of my work. I am meant to be using my current knowledge of HTML and CSS skills to create my web-based application. 

The final website needs to have a heading with my name, a navigation bar which brings the user to the various sections of my page, and several sections showing off some notes about myself, images/links to my projects, and how to contact me. 

The contents of the website should be responsive to various screen sizes. Mine is written to be responsive to screen of 992 and 768 px.
