            <p>
                I am a long-time resident of the PNW and, as such, thoroughly enjoy all the sterotypical PNW outdoor activites. I can often be found somewhere in the woods, either hiking, camping, or climbing. If it's sunny and warm outside, you can bet I'll be on the water on a kayak, a paddleboard, or a fun doughnut-patterned floatie.
                Snowboarding and indoor bouldering/climbing occupy much of my time in the winter. I'm constantly trying to tackle new snow park features and practicing my beta and moves on the wall.

                Currently, when I'm working and not playing outdoors, you can find me at No Boat Brewing Company, slinging beers, managing the taproom, and collaborating with my boss on our social media pages. Working in a craft brewery has allowed me to step into the fun world of craft beer, which has a strong community in the Seattle area.

                Prior to becoming a beertender and aspiring developer, I spent time working in the medical field, with goals of attending medical school. And even before that, back in college, I was a devoute athlete. I played volleyball for three years and college, and competed in hammerthrow on our track and field team for all four years of my career, and even competed at the NCAA DII National Championships twice.
